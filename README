I have read and understood the Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates, 
the related sections 102.01â€“102.016 and 105.15 of the UC Santa Cruz Student 
Policies and Regulations Handbook, and the related sections of the class 
syllabus.

Usage: greedy04 [-P/D] start_vertex FILE

This program reads in a weighted graph from a specified file or stdin (specify
"-" as the file).  It performs either a Prim's MST algorithm or Dijkstra's SSSP 
algorithm depending on the first argument.  The results of the algorithm are
then printed in a table.


Test file:
    test0.in is a graph taken from pg. 407 of the textbook. It has a somewhat
arbitrary direction that is not described in the book.  Expected output is:

greedy04 -P 3 test0.in:
    V | status | priority | parent
    --------------------------------
    1 |   t    |    2.0   |   2
    2 |   t    |    4.0   |   3
    3 |   t    |    0.0   |   -1
    4 |   t    |    2.0   |   3
    5 |   t    |    1.0   |   4
    6 |   t    |    1.0   |   9
    7 |   t    |    2.0   |   9
    8 |   t    |    1.0   |   4
    9 |   t    |    3.0   |   5


greedy04 -D 2 test0.in:
    V | status | priority | parent
    --------------------------------
    1 |   u    |    0.0   |   0
    2 |   t    |    0.0   |   -1
    3 |   t    |    4.0   |   2
    4 |   t    |    6.0   |   3
    5 |   t    |    7.0   |   4
    6 |   t    |   13.0   |   5
    7 |   t    |    6.0   |   2
    8 |   t    |    7.0   |   4
    9 |   t    |    8.0   |   7
    
Known bugs:
    There are likely several bugs when checking arguments and reading numbers
from a file, some reasonable measures were taken to sanitize inputs but it 
is hardly foolproof.
